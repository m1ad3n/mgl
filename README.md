### OpenGL Project

This repository is for an OpenGL based project. Setup of the project is ready but exact implementation using OpenGL needs to be decided. During the development, the features and functionalities related to OpenGL will be added.

Currently, the structure of the project is complete but nothing concerning OpenGL has been implemented. The scope of the OpenGL-related features will be further defined once the project is under active development, but it may concern rendering both 2D or 3D graphics, using shaders, getting user input in order to interact with the graphics, and also working with buffers, textures, and framebuffers.

To setup the project first clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/m1ad3n/mgl.git` and then enter the project directory. Make sure to have OpenGL installed along with the accompanying libraries (like GLFW, GLEW). Build the project using `make` and run it by using ./mgl

Makefile is only for linux users, windows build script will be added in future commits.
